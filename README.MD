# Cli-Menu-Maker

This is a very quickly made program to take a list of commands and turn it into a menu that each one can be selected from. This is all to the [consolemenu](https://crates.io/crates/console-menu) crate, mostly.

Simply take the commands.example.yml and edit it to suit your needs. You can create more than one and create a bash file to run the specific menu you want (one for game server commands, another one for opening that one log file you always need... the sky's the limit!)

Install using `cargo install cli-menu-maker`
